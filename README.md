## PSA: The code for this project is in a private repo

## Background
With the advent of crowd-sourced food delivery companies (Door Dash, Grub Hub, Uber Eats, etc.), restaurants have been able to increase their revenues dramatically through online orders. However, almost all restaurants who use such delivery companies use more than one (often 5+), which results in all of the online orders having different entry points into the restaurant. There is no centralized point where a restaurant can view all of their online orders from these various delivery services. This causes restaurants to end up using multiple iPads/tablets just to be able to view the status of their various online orders, and then manually input all of these online orders into their restaurant point-of-sale (POS) system. The increased overhead from this costs tens of thousands of dollars a year. For example, one restaurant owner reported >$100,000 in additional annual overhead from this alone.

## Solution/Product Idea
Orderflow is a much needed SaaS product idea that will solve this pain point by interfacing with all of these different delivery services, consolidating and integrating all online orders into the existing POS systems. Our project, given time constraints, will largely be the backend of this product. If we make better time than expected, we'll also work on the front-end dashboard.

## Technologies/tools
* node.js
* Postgres DB
* Postman for testing endpoints
